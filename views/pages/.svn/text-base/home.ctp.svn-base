<h1>Welcome to the Kitchen</h1>

<p>This is a demonstration site whose source code is meant to primarily illustrate usage of CakePHP's built-in ACL and Authentication Components.</p>

<p>Some elements of this site have been simplified so that emphasis is placed on usage of ACL and Authentication, so one should not use this for a
publicly accessible website "as-is".</p>

<p>This site has no official connection with the CakePHP development team.  <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/">CakePHP's Official Manual</a> 
is continually improving, and is becoming a great resource for developers.  At the same time, 
the <a href="http://api.cakephp.org/1.2/">Official API Docs</a> is 
a great go-to guide for help with specific syntax.</p>
